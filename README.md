### Reflection

Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
- I felt mostly prepared.


If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
- Spent more time organizing my requests and double-checking state flow and control
  
Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Using the API from the docs went well. I'd like to try and expand this to oranize movies with a backend somehow.
